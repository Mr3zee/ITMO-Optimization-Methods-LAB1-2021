# One-Dimensional Optimization

### Description

This repository contains 5 solutions for the one-dimensional optimization problem with the visualization done using **JavaFX**. 

Optimization methods used:

- Dichotomy Method (Binary search)
- Golden Section Search
- Fibonacci Method
- Parabolic Optimization
- Brend's Method

User can choose one of the 10 built-in functions to optimize or enter his own with range and precision. Program can show all iterations automatically or User can manually switch between them.

GUI was done in a *Shrek* style, because I was having fun during the development.
